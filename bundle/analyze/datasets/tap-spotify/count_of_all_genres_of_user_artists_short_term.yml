title: Your Top 30 Genres Listened To (Long Term)
questions: What are the top 30 genres I've listened to in the long term?
description: |-
  Your most listened to top 30 genres long term.

  Each artist can, and usually does, have multiple genres. 
  This is the count of how many times each genre appears, so you can see your overall top 10 genres.
  
  (This does mean that you likely will have more genres listed here that number of artists you've listened to).
